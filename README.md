## Hey there. My name is Stevon Wright.

I am a software developer who is always looking to improve his skills. I primarily work with front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, React), but I am trying to expand my expertise to include full-stack and mobile app development. Outside of programming, I enjoy watching YouTube and anime, as well as playing basketball, videogames (Rocket League is my favorite), guitar and piano.

### What I am currently working on

- My [portfolio website](https://stevon-wright.netlify.app/). Critiques and advice are appreciated.
- Thinking of projects (preferably full-stack) that I can make that are genuinely useful to myself and/or others.
- Networking with other professionals on LinkedIn.

### What I am learning

I am working on learning design patterns and full-stack/cross-platform development.
